/***
 * Word Ladder II
 * Description
 * Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list,
 * find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:
    Only one letter can be changed at a time
    Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
    For example,
     Given:
     beginWord = "hit"
     endWord = "cog"
     wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

     Return
     [
     ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
     ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
     ]
    1. Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
    2. All words have the same length, lowercase alphabetic characters.
    3. no duplicates in the word list.
    4. beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same..
