#### Advantages of .class
+ .class code has been type checked 
+ code is simple Distributed, safer and faster
+ protect the intellectural property

#### Object Oriented 

+ Definition: 
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized 
around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. 

+ For example, A new project is assigned to a manager. The manager alone can finish the project by 
doing requirement anaylsis, system design, development and test. This is process oriented. 
If each part is implemented by one worker, then the manager is responsible to organize these people,
here, each worker is an object. This is object oriented. It improves the work efficiency.

#### Four principles of object-oriented programming:
+ encapsulation: each object keeps its state private, inside a class
+ abstraction: each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it.
+ inheritance: reuse the common logic and extract the unique logic into a separate class+
+ polymorphism: each child class implements its own version of the methods from parent class.
same method with different implementation

#### Constructor 
code similar to a method, Define how to initiate a class

#### Static and non-static
+ non-static/instance methods can be called by an instance of a class
+ static methods or members are invoked using class name, cannot access instance method

#### reference variable
+ assign 64 bits to the address of the reference type variable, which denotes the location of the var
+ the object which var referred to can be the any size
