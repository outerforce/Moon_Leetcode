/***
 * Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
 * Description
 * An array time series data for a given stock(day i is the ith elem)
   if you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction,
   design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

     Example 1:
     Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
     Output: 5
    max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)

     Example 2:
     Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
     Output: 0
    In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
