/***
 *
 * Description
 * The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.
     Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code,
     print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
     For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:
     00 - 0
     01 - 1
     11 - 3
     10 - 2
     Note:
     For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.
